        ],
        "correctAnswer": "b",
        "explanation": "With rising medical costs in urban areas, ₹10 lakhs is the minimum recommended coverage for a family of 4. This covers most medical emergencies including ICU costs, surgeries, and treatments without depleting savings.",
        "detailedExplanation": {
          "why_b_correct": "₹10 lakhs provides adequate coverage for most medical emergencies in urban India, considering current healthcare costs and inflation.",
          "why_a_wrong": "₹5 lakhs may be insufficient for major surgeries or critical care treatments in urban hospitals.",
          "why_c_wrong": "₹15 lakhs is good but not the minimum requirement - it's more than adequate for most families.",
          "why_d_wrong": "₹20 lakhs is excellent coverage but exceeds the minimum recommendation and may be expensive for many families."
        },
        "tips": [
          "Consider top-up plans for additional coverage at lower cost",
          "Include parents in family floater or separate senior citizen plans",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "b",
        "explanation": "Financial experts recommend 8-10 times your annual income as life insurance coverage. This ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle, pay off debts, and meet future financial goals even after losing the primary income source.",
        "detailedExplanation": {
          "why_b_correct": "8-10 times annual income provides adequate financial security for dependents to maintain lifestyle and meet long-term goals.",
          "why_a_wrong": "5-7 times income may be insufficient to cover long-term family needs and major expenses like children's education.",
          "why_c_wrong": "15-20 times income is excessive and will result in very high premiums that may not be affordable.",
          "why_d_wrong": "2-3 times income is severely inadequate and won't provide meaningful financial protection to family."

          }
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "b",
        "explanation": "Most life insurance policies provide a 30-day grace period for premium payment after the due date. During this period, the policy remains in force, and if the insured dies, the claim will be paid after deducting the outstanding premium.",
        "detailedExplanation": {
          "why_b_correct": "30 days is the standard grace period provided by most life insurance companies as per IRDAI guidelines.",
          "why_a_wrong": "15 days is too short and not the standard grace period offered by insurers.",
          "why_c_wrong": "45 days is longer than the typical grace period, though some policies may offer extended grace periods.",
          "why_d_wrong": "60 days is not the standard grace period, though some insurers may offer this for specific policy types."
